### World Model implementation for fastMRI datasets to accelerate MRI scanning 

###  Generative models 
#### 1. Train VAE with random actions (need to select acceleration factor and centre fraction)
#### 2. Check VAE recons: they are blurry (WIP need to optimize)
#### 3. Generate series with random actions and k-spaces datasets to train probablistics RNN


### MDN-RNN

#### Datasets: FastMRI https://fastmri.org/ : custom enviroment, rewards are MSE between
